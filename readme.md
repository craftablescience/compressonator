# Compressonator SDK

Compressonator SDK supported codecs includes BC1-BC7/DXTC, ETC1, ETC2, ATC, ATI1N, ATI2N, all available in a single library.

This repository only contains the Compressonator SDK. Much of the code in the SDK has been stripped as well; this codebase is purely intended for raw texture format conversions.
